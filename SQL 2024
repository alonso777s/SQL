First SQL project! My own SQL code to query a Superstore Database. 

SQL query that uses a SELECT statement to order the items by price

SELECT price, item_name
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price ASC
;

SQL query that will show a statistic about the item prices

SELECT MIN(price), MAX(price), AVG(price)
FROM superstore
;

SQL query that will show a statistic about the price for items in the category of "Electronics".

SELECT MIN(price), MAX(price), AVG(price), "Electronics"
FROM superstore
WHERE category="Electronics"
;

SQL query that will show a statistic about the price for items in the category of "Kitchen Supplies".

SELECT "Kitchen Supplies", MIN(price), MAX(price), AVG(price)
FROM superstore
WHERE category="Kitchen Supplies"
;

SQL query that will show a statistic about the price and stock for items in the category of "Kitchen Supplies".

SELECT "Kitchen Supplies", MIN(price), MAX(price), AVG(price), COUNT(stock_quantity)
FROM superstore
WHERE category="Kitchen Supplies"
;
