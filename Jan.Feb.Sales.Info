In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

**How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales

**How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product="iPhone";

**Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers cx
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales fs
ON cx."order_id"=fs.orderID;

**Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 

SELECT DISTINCT Product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE  price IN (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

**What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT Product,SUM(Quantity)*price AS Revenue FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY ASC;

**Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity)*price AS Revenue FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location="548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY Product;

**How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT(cx.acctnum), AVG(Quantity*price) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales fs
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cx
ON fs.orderid=cx.order_id
WHERE fs.Quantity>2;

**List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold

SELECT distinct Product, COUNT(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;
